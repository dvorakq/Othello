Othello: Villain or Tragic Hero

# Background information

Othello is set in late 15th century Venice, where the homonymous protagonist plays the role of a Moorish military commander who was serving as the general of the Venetian army. Othello served to defend Cyprus against the invasian of the Ottoman Turks.
Othello and his youthful wife Desdemona face much adversity, due to the oppressing societal norms and values of the time. Othello is discriminated for his racial and cultural background, this maltreatment is a large factor for Othello's downfall and transition into villainy.
Desdemona is the victim of the brutal objectification and sexism of the era. Shakespeare expresses this in "Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! Thieves! theives!" she is catagorised as an object, a bag or asset of sorts. Shakespeare uses the word thieves to portray Desdemona as something stealable as if she has no independence of her own.
Othello mirrors the tensions experienced during the conflict between Venetians and Ottomans. The sheer manipulation alone can reflect the powerful conflict flawlessly.

# Character analysis

The characters in the play Othello develop significantly as an effect of many factors, such as: The societal norms and values, the war of cyprus and most importantly powerful use of potent manipulation. The manipulation of Othello is prevelent in the play, and performed pesteringly by Iago. Iago breaks down his militaric like stoic stature to a fine dust, until Othello finally breaks towards the conclusion of the play, this fracture of his ego and sanity provides a climax in the form of murdering his own innocent wife Desdemona.
Iago is jealous of Othello's position and societal status, as a result of this jealousy he manipulates Othello subtly in the beginning of the play, although the realisation of his power and influence over Othello's motions corrupts Iago further. This toxicity results in Iago feeding off Othello's suffering, depicting Iago as a pest or a maggot feeding off a corpse of a once great man.
