Othello: Villain or Tragic Hero

# Background information

Othello is set in late 15th century Venice, where the homonymous protagonist plays the role of a Moorish military commander who was serving as the general of the Venetian army. Othello served to defend Cyprus against the invasian of the Ottoman Turks.
Othello and his youthful wife Desdemona face much adversity, due to the oppressing societal norms and values of the time. Othello is discriminated for his racial and cultural background, this maltreatment is a large factor for Othello's downfall and transition into villainy.
Desdemona is the victim of the brutal objectification and sexism of the era. Shakespeare expresses this in "Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! Thieves! theives!" she is catagorised as an object, a bag or asset of sorts. Shakespeare uses the word thieves to portray Desdemona as something stealable as if she has no independence of her own.
Othello mirrors the tensions experienced during the conflict between Venetians and Ottomans. The sheer manipulation alone can reflect the powerful conflict flawlessly.

# Character analysis + theme analysis

## Othello
The characters in the play Othello develop significantly as an effect of many factors, such as: The societal norms and values, the war of cyprus and most importantly powerful use of potent manipulation. The manipulation of Othello is prevelent in the play, and performed pesteringly by Iago. Iago breaks down his militaric like stoic stature to a fine dust, until Othello finally breaks towards the conclusion of the play, this fracture of his ego and sanity provides a climax in the form of murdering his own innocent wife Desdemona.
## Iago
Iago works almost every character in the play, his ways are similar to that of a puppet master, he manipulates the fabric of reality while remaining just invisible to the naked eye. An example mistreatnment and manipulation can be seen in "For he conjured her she should ever keep it /That she reserves it evermore about her/ To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out/ And give ʼt to Iago. What he will do with it/ Heaven knows, not I. /I nothing but to please his fantasy." where he exploits Emilia's loyalty and unconditional love for his own benefit.
Iago is jealous of Othello's position and societal status, as a result of this jealousy he manipulates Othello subtly in the beginning of the play, although the realisation of his power and influence over Othello's motions corrupts Iago further. This toxicity results in Iago feeding off Othello's suffering, depicting Iago as a pest or maggot feeding from a corpse of a once great man.
## Desdemona
Desdemona is a victim of crossfire, a poppy in no mans land, witnessing conflict although unable to interfere. Shakespeare uses her to display the feeling of impotency, incapable of preventing her own inevitable demise. As the play approaches it's end Othello suffocates Desdemona with a pillow, this signifies her literal suffocation beneath the demands placed on her fidelity.
## Roderigo
Roderigo holds love for Desdemona but this love is far from mutual, because of this he carries faint jealousy for Othello. Iago uses this to his advantage and amplifies Roderigo's jealousy.
## Cassio
Othello's beloved and trusted captain, Cassio, is used as a puppet in Iago's treasonous plot. Iago uses Cassio to confuse Othello, and give Othello the feeling that his world his collapsing right infront his eyes. In the line "I am glad I have found this napkin,/ This was her first remembrance from the Moor./ My wayward husband hath a hundred times/ Wooed me to steal it, but she so loves the token/" Iago uses Emilia to obtain Desdemona's handkerchief, and plants it (which Othello passed on from generations to Desdemona) in Cassio's possession. This turns Othello against Cassio, and thus marks the beginning of Othello's true spiral into madness.

# Symbolism + Imagery

## Handkerchief
Symbolism and imagery is often used in Othello to represent emotion, lore and racism. Desdemona's handkerchief is a clear example of Shakespeare's representation of emotion and sexism, the pattern of strawberries on a white background profoundly embodies the bloodstains left on a virgins wedding night. The virgins blood guarantees virginity and fidelity of the beholder, this is why Othello gifted the handkerchief from generations to Desdemona. She keeps this handkerchief close to her as a sign of affection towards Othello. In the stansa "I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin And let him find it. Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ. This may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison" Iago plans to plant the handkerchief in Cassio's hands to manipulate Othello into believing that she withholds love for him.
## Animal Imagery
Othello is discriminated against for his race. He is depicted as a ravenous beast by Iago (and later Roderigo), clutching helpless Desdemona by his side.
This imagery can be seen in "Even now, now very now, an old black ram / is tupping your white ewe." where Iago suggests that Desdemona has been unwillingly taken and raped by Othello. This suggests that Iago believes interracial relationships are unnatural and could not be consensual, this is a common belief during this era.
You could suggest that the animal imagery foreshadows what is to come: the murder of Desdemona by Othello's hand, because of his twisted morality and values. It proposes this because of the brutal imagery of a beast, Othello harming the defenseless Desdemona.

# Conclusion
The play Othello begins in Venice and ends in Venice. This lack of deviation is far from the difference experienced in the character's personas. In the beginning, all is sweet and innocent, but as Iago tightens his strings of puppetry the many characters emotions fall into his grasp, and are then doctored to his aid. (engineered to his advantage)
This social engineering induces the brutal murder of Desdemona by her one tragic husband. Who then later kill himself with a piercing blade. After this Iago, is arrested, but does this even matter, his damage has already been done as Iago had stated "This is the night/ That either makes me or fordoes me quite.".
Othello's relevance in modern culture can still be observed to this very day. This beautiful and passionat play truly is a timeless classic.
